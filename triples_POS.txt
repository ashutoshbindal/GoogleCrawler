The	DT
aim	NN
of	IN
supervised	VBN

machine	NN
learning	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO
build	VB
a	DT
model	NN
that	WDT
makes	VBZ
predictions	NNS
based	VBN
on	IN
evidence	NN
in	IN
the	DT
presence	NN
of	IN

As	IN
adaptive	JJ
algorithms	NNS
identify	VBP
patterns	NNS
in	IN
data	NNS
,	,
a	DT
computer	NN
``	``
learns	VBZ
''	''
from	IN
the	DT
observations	NNS

When	WRB
exposed	VBN
to	TO
more	JJR
observations	NNS

the	DT
computer	NN
improves	VBZ
its	PRP$
predictive	JJ
performance	NN
.	.

Specifically	RB
,	,
a	DT
supervised	JJ
learning	NN
algorithm	NN
takes	VBZ
a	DT
known	JJ
set	NN
of	IN
input	NN
data	NNS

known	JJ
responses	NNS
to	TO
the	DT
data	NNS
-LRB-	-LRB-

-RRB-	-RRB-
,	,
and	CC
trains	NNS
a	DT

to	TO
generate	VB
reasonable	JJ
predictions	NNS
for	IN
the	DT
response	NN
to	TO
new	JJ
data	NNS
.	.
.	.

For	IN

,	,
suppose	VB
you	PRP
want	VBP
to	TO
predict	VB
whether	IN
someone	NN
will	MD
have	VB
a	DT
heart	NN

within	IN

You	PRP
have	VBP
a	DT

So	RB

the	DT

is	VBZ
combining	VBG

a	DT

a	DT

You	PRP

You	PRP
